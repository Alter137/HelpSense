# HelpSense
<i>A practical plugin with a variety of features, solving all your troubles with just one plugin!</i>

**NwAPI**
<br><br>

## What kind of plugin is HelpSense?
**HelpSense** is a free plugin packed with many useful features, written with the ultra-stable **NwAPI**.\
By installing this plugin, you can gain many new features not available in the base game.

## Features
**HelpSense** offers many features, such as:
- Chat system (.bc .c)
- Server sweeper (cleans up useless corpses and items to reduce server load)
- Various security team (at the start, security guards have a chance to become elite or defectors, otherwise they remain normal with one team leader)
- Proximity card (No more worries about getting locked in access-restricted rooms while playing as Tesla cannon operator)
- Vote refresh, time, halftime, nuke display (It's refreshing quickly!)
- Stay anywhere on the map before the round starts (No more staring at boring loading screens!)
- .ac private message to admin (Someone cheating? Violating rules? Use .ac to inform the admin for punishment!)
- Custom server broadcast (Want players to join your group? Custom broadcast has got you covered!)
- Infinite ammo (Players always complaining about running out of bullets? Infinite ammo solves that problem! SCP: I’ve got an early class!)
- MTF Kappa-10 "Skynet" (079 can’t win? Sorry, Skynet MTF comes with a powerful spotlight and speeds up telegraph startup time)
- Round-end battle (Is a normal round ending too dull? Make the round-ending a custom battle between characters!)
- Spectator display (Feel like someone’s watching you? This feature lets you know who’s spectating you)
- Self-rescue command (Accidentally bugged and fell into the void? .ZiJiu saves you!)
- Shooting range lobby (Bored at the start? Try your guns in the shooting range!)
- Player information query (Want to know how long you’ve played on the server or how many kills you’ve made? Try .info!)
- See No Evil MTF (Accidentally looking at SCP-096 every time as NTF? Join the Don't-look-at-me MTF and look all you want!)
- SCP health system (SCP too weak? Add some extra health!)
- Surface overhaul (Don’t like the original surface? Let me transform it for you)
- DD starter card (DD too useless? Doesn’t even have an item? Let me assist you!)
- SCP-703 (This character is so cool, it can create something out of nothing)
- SCP-029 (Upgraded DD version, really cool)
- SCP-1056 (Looks like a medical kit, but turns into a loli when used)
- SCP-1068 (Looks like a spotlight, but when used, the nuke goes "boom" without fully exploding)
- Chaos leader (Our chaos army needs a leader, and he should have the best equipment)
- SCP-191 (Is 079 re-contained? Game over? No! The high-resistance SCP broke containment!)
- SCP-073 (Need my help? I agree. My damage reduction is no joke, and there's even a damage rebound)
- SCP-347 (I'm right beside you~)
- SCP-1093 (One person holding a lamp? Feels bad. He doesn’t seem to have a head.)
